## The Bivariate Marginal Distribution ALgorithm

--- 

This repository implements a Python code for the paper 

> Pelikan, Martin, and Heinz MÃ¼hlenbein. "The bivariate marginal distribution algorithm." Advances in Soft Computing. Springer, London, 1999. 521-535.

As a educational code, its implementation is not aimed at high-end performance applications. Instead, legibility in the 
was kept as clear as possible. 

Feel free to use this code as you seem more appropriate, citing the authors:

```latex
